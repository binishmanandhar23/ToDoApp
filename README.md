# ToDoApp
Made for CloudyFox

## Details
- I've used the ViewModel approach for gathering the necessary data (fetching checklists & reminders) from repository
- I've used realm for storing data
- I've written tests for some of the function in androidTest (ToDoRepoTest.kt)
- For now, we can only create the checklists & reminders and cannot update or delete the items.
